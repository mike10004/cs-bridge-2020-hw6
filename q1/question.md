# Question 1

The Fibonacci numbers sequence, F<sub>n</sub>, is defined as follows:
F<sub>1</sub> is 1, F<sub>2</sub> is 1, and F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub> for n = 3, 4, 5, ...

In other words, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. 
The first 10 numbers in Fibonacci sequence are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55

Note: Background of Fibonacci sequence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

1. Write a function int fib(int n) that returns the n-th element of the 
   Fibonacci sequence.
2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer num, and 
   then prints the numâ€™s elements in the Fibonacci sequence.

Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the 
following example:

    Please enter a positive integer: 7
    13
